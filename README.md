# Almost-prime
n number theory, a natural number is called k-almost prime if it has k prime factors. More formally, a number n is k-almost prime if and only if Ω(n) = k, where Ω(n) is the total number of primes in the prime factorization of n. A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-almost prime, and semiprime if and only if it is 2-almost prime. The set of k-almost primes is usually denoted by Pk. The smallest k-almost prime is 2k.
